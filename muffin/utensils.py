    Kleene's fixed point.

    Ascend from a bottom value to a recursively-defined value. Usage is
    similar to a general fixed-point combinator, like U, Y, or Z, but with
    memoization and an explicit bottom value. This decorator can thus be used
    to deal with ill-founded recursion, as long as the values involved are
    sufficiently pure; if this decorator sees a value twice under the same
    circumstances, it will "bottom out" and ensure that the computation
    terminates eventually.
